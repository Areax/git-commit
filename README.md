# git-committed

A simple slack bot inspired by https://github.com/adymitruk/keep-me-commiting to keep project coders committed to the project by providing messages telling the user they haven't committed in x days.
Currently, the bot runs based on public commits made by the user for any project.

TO DO list: 
* Run publicly or privately, depending on project specifications.
* Specify a project
* Specify how often the bot checks using Cron
* Specify the bot's username and picture
* Specify messages the bot tells users
* Specify number of days before the bot tells users they haven't committed (along with the messages)
* Make it usable for discord as well!

# To Run

`node index.js`
